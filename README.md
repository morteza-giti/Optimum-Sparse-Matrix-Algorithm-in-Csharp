# Optimum Sparse Matrix Algorithm in C#
This project presents an efficient algorithm for working with sparse matrices, aiming to optimize storage and operations for matrices that contain mostly zero elements. Sparse matrices are common in various domains, such as scientific computing, machine learning, and data analysis, where huge datasets often have a significant number of zero values.
